It is apparent that South Africa s mining industry is one of the most dangerous to be working in; this was said by The Federation of Unions of South Africa (Fedusa) in April this year at the International Day of Occupational Health and Safety.At the same day The International Labour Organisation held a campaign that mainly focused on the critical need for countries to improve their capacity to collect and utilise reliable occupational safety and health (OSH) data.This is said to provide and to promote inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all and focuses on the protection of labour rights and promotion of safe and secure working environments for all workers, including migrant workers.Fedusa General Secretary Dennis George said that many cases of occupational accidents and related deaths occurred in the mining industry. Singling out the tragic incident at the Lily Mine in Mpumalanga where three miners remain trapped underground since February.Pearl Nkosi, Technical Director of Blugrey Occupational Hygiene, the company that specialize in supply of mining health and safety services said Occupational Health and Safety in the Mining Industry has more to do with the global wellbeing than mines within which individuals are working. Blugrey is been working within the mining industry since 2015 and they provide services in risk assessment, occupational hygiene programme establishment and implementation they also do health and safety systems.Nkosi also said mines contribute significantly to the occupational disease burden via the airborne contaminants that are either incorrectly quantified because the quality management systems for monitoring are either non-existent or are neglected.The government is expected to be keeping a close eye on the regulations of occupational health within the country, Lebo Parkies of OHS CARE an Occupational Health and Surveillance Company said there s been a proliferation of fly by night Occupational Health Services companies whose focus has been to purely compete on pricing and compromise on quality and legislative compliance. OHS CARE services include Occupational Health Services, Medical Surveillance Programme, Mobile and Fixed Clinic Services, Baseline Medical Examination, Incapacity Management, Health Risk Assessments, Biological Monitoring, Occupational Disease Management, MBOD, WCA and RMA Submissions.Parkies further said Occupational Health Services industry ought to be fully regulated mainly to protect unsuspecting clients and also to ensure that industry participants are providing quality service by being fully compliant to recognized operating standards both locally and internationally. George said: It is important for government, business and organised labour to focus attention on participating actively in securing a safety and health culture in workplaces in terms of the Occupational Health and Safety Act. George added: It is therefore important to strengthen the existing culture of health and safety in the mining industry through promoting learning and building capacity to make the workplaces safer and healthier. He said Fedusa remained committed to promoting better working conditions for workers and to raising awareness about the magnitude of the problem of occupational or work-related fatalities, diseases and injuries . George said the government needed to enforce strict measures of compliance to the regulations of the Occupational Health and Safety Act .He said they should implement a preventive safety and health culture in their workplaces through education, training and issuing safe work gear where needed, so employees could safely perform their work. George also appealed to employees to comply with the health and safety regulations in their workplaces.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
