Perhaps taking a leaf from the tough stance of Tanzania s President John Magufuli, the Zambia Revenue Authority (ZRA) Commissioner General, , has directed that all exports of minerals and minerals ores and concentrates should be analysed using the X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) Analysers before exiting the Zambian borders, Lusaka Times reported yesterday.According to Lusaka Times, Chanda has given the directive in light of the 18 XRF Analysers procured under the Mineral Value Chain Monitoring Project and have been distributed to all border posts.Shedding more light on the move, Chanda said the XRF Analysers were procured to assist with the confirmation of the quality of the minerals being exported through the Zambian borders.XRF Analysers are machines used to detect specific mineral content in mineral exports.Chanda also directed that the risk management criteria should be revised to reflect this change and include all mineral exports by Accredited Clients to undergo physical inspection and XRF analysis before being released.The Commissioner General said this process was expected to take not more than five minutes, and therefore, would not delay trucks at the borders.Chanda warned that any discrepancies in the readings at the two inspection points would result in the exporter being questioned and appropriate sanctions imposed if it is discovered that there was a wrong declaration on the quality of the mineral exports.He said all results from the analysis would be sent to the Mineral Data Analysis Centre (MIDAC) for further review and follow-ups.To ensure full compliance to this guideline by all stations, a Monthly Consolidated Report per station wil be sent to his office by 5th of the following month.Recently, there have been reports of mining companies exporting precious metals especially gold, using falsified mineral content analysis reports.This has resulted in gross under valuations of gold exports thereby, affecting revenue collection from mining companies.
