One of Southern Africa s best known quarrying and mining industry representative associations, Aspasa, has changed its name to reflect a growing and diverse member-base.For almost two decades the association has represented the sand and aggregate quarrying industry and has assisted the sector to navigate challenging times in which legislation has become considerably more challenging and pressures on the overall mining sector have increased tenfold.During this time, its tireless efforts to formalise and steer the industry have yielded considerable results and led to the industry being acknowledged as a leader in the fields of health, safety and environmental management locally, as well as globally by peer organisations such as the Global Aggregates Information Network (GAIN).Sustainable utilisation Our work to represent the industry and create a safe, sustainable, fair and level playing field has led to organisations outside of the quarrying industry requesting assistance and membership. As a result we have taken the decision to act broadly on the entire opencast and related mining industries, wherever operations are similar and face similar challenges. As a result, we have adopted the salt and dimension stone mining industries, as well as incorporating the Coal Ash Association into our care. We are also open to any other opencast mining operations applying for membership and agreeing to uphold our strict standards and be legally compliant with the legislation. Membership is open to:&nbsp;Household name By signing up, members will be required to be compliant with all legal and statutory requirements, as well as undergoing two annual audits to affirm compliance with our own health and safety and separate environmental standards that are closely allied to ISO standards. Aspasa is a well-known brand name and one that is synonymous with action on behalf of its members. We will therefore retain the acronym only and no longer be known as the Aggregate and Sand Producers Association of Southern Africa. This will be phased out during the next few months as our branding become aligned with the name change, says Aspasa&#8216;s Nico Pienaar.Opencast mines, mineral excavations and waste mineral operations seeking formalisation and membership of Aspasa can contact Aspasa (011) 791 3327, Fax: 086 647 8034, Email: &#x6e;&#x69;&#x63;&#x6f;&#64;Aspa&#x73;&#x61;&#x2e;&#x63;&#111;.za, Web: www.Aspasa.co.za
