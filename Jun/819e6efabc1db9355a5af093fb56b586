It was highlighted during last years s Comminution &#8217;16 that there are many innovations that are taking place in comminution, the most important, yet the most energy intensive area of the mineral processing flow sheet.Grinding is evolving and changing fast, with innovations in high pressure grinding rolls and stirred mills threatening to make the tumbling mill, which has been a stalwart for well over a century, obsolete one can say.But innovation in crushing has not been so rapid, and most of the developments reported in this area have been in control, simulation and optimisation of crushing circuits, rather than in new developments in the machines themselves.Indeed only two years ago, at Comminution &#8217;14, Tim Napier-Munn mentioned that in the 1970s Professor Klaus Schonert showed that the most energy-efficient way to break a rock was to place it between two opposed platens and load it until it fractured in tension, this simple mechanism seriously limiting the options regarding real innovation in the comminution process.To support this view he showed a sketch of one of today s cone crushers showing that in all material respects it is identical to a cone crusher manufactured in the 1930s.&nbsp;Although the downward commodity pricing cycle continues to make operating conditions increasingly challenging in the African mining sector it is always good to see development or changes in the world of Crushing and Screening. Chinese based company LIMING Co. is also manufacturing some of the world s most used machines.LIMING mainly provide the stone crushing equipment , complete stone crushing line and the related Auxiliary equipment. Our main products are Vibrating Feeder, Jaw Crusher, Cone Crusher, Impact Crusher, Sand Making Machine, Vibrating Screen, Belt Conveyors, etc. . They have the so called Jaw Crusher which they claim it is ideally suitable as a primary and secondary crusher for material with compression strength less than 320Mpa.They say this Jaw Crusher is of high crushing ratio, larger capacity, well distributed final product size, simple structure, reliable performance and convenient maintenance. It is widely used in mining, metallurgy and also in construction.
