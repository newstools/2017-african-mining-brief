Vert Energy provides a standby and power solutions service to companies and communities, even those in the most isolated regions. Through an extensive range of quality branded EPG products, supported by a skilled team of technical experts, the company plays a major role in providing dependable power in areas that are off-grid and where power supply is not constant, or reliable, says Vert Energy s managing director, Grant Robertson. Vert Energy teamed up with the DEIF Group over three years ago as exclusive distributors in sub-Saharan Africa, of DEIF generator controls, known globally for critical power and decentralised power applications. This partnership has been boosted with the recent appointment of Ga tan Floriach, a highly qualified DEIF engineer, who is based at Vert Energy in Johannesburg for a two year period, to further develop DEIF business in Africa. Apart from the supply and support of power generation components for diesel and gas engines, Vert Energy s service focuses on companies investing in alternative sources of electricity production, particularly solar power. The growing trend to utilise environmentally-friendly photovoltaic (PV) technology to convert solar energy to electricity, requires dependable power generation systems, which need to be supported by technically competent skills. To meet market demand, Vert Energy has made a substantial investment in extending its range of components for renewable energy and an ongoing training programme keeps the team abreast with the latest technologies. New to the range is the DEIF automatic sustainable controller (ASC) the first sustainable control solution for renewable energy of its kind. This fully control integrated system provides a safe and reliable link between renewable energy inverters and traditional diesel generators. DEIF control instrumentation also includes genset controllers, protection relays and interfaces, as well as switchboards and panels. DEIF power management products have advanced control technology features for optimum performance, high accuracy, improved safety, minimal maintenance requirements and reduced downtime. Solutions encompass marine and offshore technology, wind power and diesel control technology, as well as gas and hydro control technology. DEIF s green technology focuses on energy efficiency, fuel optimisation and reduced emissions. Other EPG components in Vert Energy s range include Leroy Somer alternators, ASCO automatic transfer switches; API Covrad radiators and Avtron and Froment load banks, as well as customised control panels. AllightSykes MSGEN2 lighting towers, which offer over 50 000 hours of light per unit, are also new to Vert Energy. A critical part of Vert Energy s service, is the availability throughout Africa of factory and OEM trained technicians who cope efficiently with any electro-mechanical breakdown situation or routine preventative maintenance procedures. The company s field services encompass re-assembly, installation and commissioning, inspections and diagnostics, as well as on site maintenance and repair work.
