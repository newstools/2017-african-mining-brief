KSB Pumps and Valves recently added the new generation Etabloc close-coupled pump range to its line-up of efficient water pumps.The newly enhanced series comprises 43 pump sizes, which can be driven by either 2-pole or 4-pole motors. With further additions to the selection chart, the pump size can now be selected even closer to the best efficiency point.KSB close-coupled pumps have applications in a wide range of industries including agriculture, industrial and municipal water pumping. Different material types and seal and nozzle types available for the range also extends its usage into other materials ranging from foodstuffs, to chemical, waste and a number of other usages.More versatileAccording to KSB Pumps and Valves regional sales manager, David Jones, the discharge nozzles are fitted with more connection options for pressure gauges as standard, so several measurements can be conducted at the same time. The flanges of suction and discharge nozzles are optionally drilled to EN 1092 or ASME dimensions, for all materials.A large variety of nozzle positions and installation options enables maximum flexibility. Confined gaskets ensure reliable sealing between pump casing and casing cover, even in highly varying operating conditions.Another feature of the updated type series is its particularly service-friendly design. The conical seal chamber, for example, allows easy access and provides more space for maintenance work. The new, spacious design facilitates dismantling and reassembly of the mechanical seals. Forcing screws provided at the lantern make dismantling of the drive train much easier. Easy-to-replace casing wear rings protect the impeller and the casing cover from wear.Low energyThe drive lantern comes in standardised mating dimensions, offering the operator maximum choice in selecting an electric motor. In line with KSB&#8217;s common practice for industrial pumps, every pump will be supplied to the customer with the impeller diameter trimmed exactly to the duty point. Impeller trimming combined with the large range of pump sizes available for selection is the only way of keeping the pump set&#8217;s energy consumption to the minimum necessary.The latest generation of the Etabloc type series meets strict global standards including the EU requirements of Commission Regulation 547/2012/EU for water pumps.KSB Pumps and Valves, Annett Kriel, Tel: (011) 876 5600, Fax: (011) 822 1746, Email: Annett.Kr&#105;&#101;&#108;&#64;&#x6b;&#x73;&#x62;&#x2e;&#x63;&#x6f;&#x6d;, Web: www.ksbpumps.co.za
