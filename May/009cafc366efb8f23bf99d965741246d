Acacia Mining, the LSE-listed miner, has declared that it will fight the Tanzanian government s ban on exporting gold and copper concentrates which has been in effect since February this year.In a press statement released on its website, following the Presidential Committee s findings that allege that company has been flouting the ban, Acacia says it will prove that it has been complying.Acacia says it fully declares everything of commercial value that it produces and pays all appropriate royalties and taxes on all of the payable minerals that it produces.&#8220;Since the directive restricting exports, neither Acacia Mining nor its customers have attempted to export our gold and copper concentrates,&#8221; the company says.The Presidential Committee s investigations indicate that Acacia Mining has not fully declared all of the minerals contained in the concentrate and the directive halting the export of metallic mineral concentrates remains in place.&nbsp;
