The Just Gold project is the first to successfully trace conflict-free and legal artisanal gold from mine site to export applying regional and international standardsPartnership Africa Canada has announced the Just Gold project has successfully implemented a system to trace legal and conflict-free artisanal gold in the Democratic Republic of Congo.The Just Gold project began as a pilot in Ituri Province in 2015. Today&#8217;s announcement is a milestone for the project moving it from the pilot stage having proven a successful chain of custody from mine site to exporter.&#8220;After almost two years of testing the Just Gold project with an aim to develop a chain of custody and due diligence system for artisanal gold in DRC, we are excited to share news of our success,&#8221; said Joanne Lebert, Partnership Africa Canada&#8217;s Executive Director.&#8220;The Just Gold project can now move from a period of testing to implementation and ensuring we have a long-term, sustainable and viable solution for traceable, legal and conflict-free exports of artisanal gold from Congo,&#8221; said Lebert. &#8220;We look forward to sharing our lessons learned with key actors and to deepening our collaboration with the DRC Government.&#8221;The Just Gold project creates incentives for artisanal gold miners to channel their product to legal exporters and eventually responsible consumers by offering fair and transparent pricing and by providing capacity-building, such as technical assistance to miners in return for legal sales. Miners are taught better exploitation techniques and offered Juts Gold project equipment, in return for which any gold produced must be tracked and sold through legal channels.&#8220;Proving that artisanal gold in eastern Congo can be conflict-free, legal and traceable is a major step in responsible sourcing efforts in the Great Lakes region. The government of Democratic Republic of Congo is taking major strides in complying with regional standards and demonstrating how the implementation the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains can contribute to progressive improvements in the sector, supporting artisanal gold men and women miners to enter international markets,&#8221; said Lebert.Partnership Africa Canada signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Democratic Republic of Congo&#8217;s Minister of Mines Martin Kabwelulu on September 2016, outlining support for the organization&#8217;s activities to strengthen natural resource governance. Specifically, the Ministry of Mines recognized the Just Gold project as a system of traceability and encouraged its implementation. Partnership Africa Canada has provided technical support to the Ministry since 2011.Current activities in DRC include the Just Gold project, capacity building to implement both the International Conference on the Great Lakes (ICGLR) Regional Certification Mechanism (RCM) and the OECD Due Diligence Guidance applicable to high-value minerals, as well as support to civil society for monitoring and reporting on supply chain integrity.Partnership Africa Canada has also undertaken research and analysis of the artisanal gold supply chain to understand women&#8217;s roles in the sector. Through sensitization and outreach, the Just Gold project improves awareness of women&#8217;s rights, and their right to access, control and benefit of resources. The project also supports and fosters women&#8217;s leadership opportunities through skills-building and training.Partnership Africa Canada&#8217;s work in DRC developed from its engagement as a technical partner to the ICGLR, providing capacity-building to implement the six tools developed by the ICGLR&#8217;s Regional Initiative against the Illegal Exploitation of Natural Resources.Funding for the Just Gold project and Partnership Africa Canada&#8217;s work in the Great Lakes region is provided by Global Affairs Canada. Additional funding for the Just Gold project is provided by USAID through the Capacity Building for Responsible Minerals Trade (CBRMT) project and International Organization for Migration
