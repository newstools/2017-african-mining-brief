As the operator of the largest independent high speed dynamic balancing machine in sub-Saharan Africa, Marthinusen &amp; Coutts, a division of ACTOM, has an in-depth understanding of the importance of precision-balancing rotating machines.Mike Chamberlain, marketing and commercial executive at this leading local repairer of rotating electrical and mechanical equipment, points out how critical it is to ensure the highest degree of accuracy when balancing rotating machines as this will minimise vibration levels thereby increasing reliability and reducing maintenance costs.The 32 ton Schenck HM7 U/S balancing machine, located at Marthinusen &amp; Coutts 9 500 m high- tech workshop in Cleveland, near Johannesburg, is in constant use. Our customers, which include major local and international OEMs, benefit significantly through access to an independent balancing service offering with this level of capacity and quality. The HM7 U/S balancing machine has a measuring range between 100 and 5000 r.p.m.. It is nine metres long, has a journal size of 400 mm and a swing of 2,4 metres. The machine is fitted with a CAB 920 H computer measuring system with advanced functionality. This state-of-the-art technology makes changeovers to new rotor types quick and straightforward, and the machine is capable of balancing larger high-speed rotors dynamically at full operating speed, Chamberlain says. He adds that, on occasion, and depending on the design of the rotor and the individual customer requirement, balancing can be done at 10% overspeed or more if required.In-house balancing of rotors not only speeds up the process; it also reduces the cost and the turnaround time of repairs. The machine is available to external customers on a first-come-first-served request.Marthinusen &amp; Coutts also performs on site vibration and dynamic balancing with its recently acquired Bently Nevada ADRE 408 portable vibration and balancing system.
