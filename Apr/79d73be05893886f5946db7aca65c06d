One of the largest orders in the history of SEW-EURODRIVE South Africa for its MC Series industrial gear units is being supplied to a gold-mining project in Kazakhstan, which will see the assembly and supply of 31 of these units. The OEM won the order from a local specialist in the design and supply of equipment to the metallurgical industry. What made it such a unique project for us was the low ambient temperatures that we had to accommodate in the specification, Rudi Swanepoel, Head of Projects at SEW-EURODRIVE, explains.This meant that special oil tanks with heaters had to be fitted to the units. While this is available as a standard feature, it is not a run-of-the-mill requirement. Other features that had to be installed as well included flow switches. We also had to meet the required loads of the application, which are considerable in terms of agitators, Swanepoel adds.The MC Series of industrial gear units comprise particularly compact helical and helical-bevel gear units. The torque range of the seven sizes is 6 kNm to 65 kNm. The parallel shaft design offers plenty of flexibility in system design, in addition to requiring remarkably little space. This makes it ideal for a range of applications, from materials handling to transporting heavy loads, mixing, crane drives, and shredders. A version with Extended Bearing Distance (EBD) and reinforced output shaft is also available for more specific applications.Swanepoel says the collaboration with its client in fulfilling this order for Kazakhstan represents a latest trend in the increasing internationalisation of projects. It also sends a highly positive message about the manufacturing experience and expertise of SEW-EURODRIVE South Africa, which is increasingly sought-after the world over. Long perceived as a gear specialist, SEW-EURODRIVE has transformed into a total solutions provider, capable of assisting with any project from conception to design and equipment supply.&nbsp;
