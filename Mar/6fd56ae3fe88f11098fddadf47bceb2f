 Global pump manufacturer, KSB Pumps and Valves, has established an independent operation in Zambia to ensure that its rapidly expanding customer base has full access to the company s world-class sales and support services.Having previously been represented by a network of agencies and dealers throughout the country, the growing number of pumps in the field, as well as burgeoning demand from the agricultural and mining sectors, has prompted the company to invest in more suitable infrastructure within the region.According to KSB Pumps and Valves regional sales manager, David Jones, the formal establishment of KSB Zambia is aimed at taking the market to an entirely new level with improved stock holdings, shorter lead times for the procurement of pumps, improved price stability and onsite service and support for customers.Zambian solutions We rather elected to buy a controlling share in Kitwe-based pump company, Aqua Africa, that is well-established in the copperbelt and is a well-liked company in Zambia. Simultaneously we also established a branch in Lusaka that will cater largely for the agricultural market, as well as being well positioned to support water and infrastructural requirements of the residential and industrial markets. Now that the bricks and mortar are in we are planning to double our efforts and reach out to existing and new customers and we think the market is going to like what they see., says David.KSB Zambia managing director, Alf Jacobsen, says when KSB approached him it was an easy decision to make as it was a move in the right direction for his company, as well as for the Zambian pump market. Right now agriculture is in a strong position and there is a lot of room for us to grow that part of the market. Similarly, mining will always be a strong focus here in the copperbelt and with full access to the entire range of KSB pumps and slurry pumps it bodes well for us to grow this sector in future.Growing forward We want to become a one-stop-shop for pump, valves and fluid transfer requirements across all industries and will steadily build a stock holding of pumps and parts that is appropriate for the market. This has the potential to quadruple our footprint world class products and support locally, as well as from KSB South Africa and the global network of experts. From a customer point of view, it will be encouraging to know that they are now dealing directly with one of the world s major contenders in the pump market and that support and backup will be in line with world standards, Alf says.KSB dealer manager for sub-Saharan Africa, Andreas Gremels adds that the move into Zambia is the first in a number of investments that the company plans to make within the sub-Saharan Africa region. &#8220;There is considerable investment going on in Africa in terms of both infrastructure and industry.KSB South Africa will support this development with further investments into countries in East, Central, West and Southern Africa with a emphasis on countries that already have large KSB pump populations such as Angola, Namibia, Mozambique, Botswana and Tanzania, eventually covering all major countries in Sub-Sahara Africa.
