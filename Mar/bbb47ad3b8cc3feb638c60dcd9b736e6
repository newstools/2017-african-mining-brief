Schneider Electric, a global specialist in energy management and automation, has added advanced Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) technologies to its industrial software portfolio with the acquisition of MWPowerlab.MWPowerlab&#8217;s industry-leading 3D real-time technology gives customers the benefit of strengthened Immersive Simulation and Training capabilities and advanced 3D visualisation which increase safety standards, improve labour effectiveness and increase asset performance on a global scale. VR and AR technologies will enhance Schneider Electric&#8217;s Enterprise Asset Performance Management offering.Schneider Electric and MWPowerlab have enjoyed a long and rich history of delivering Immersive Operator Training and Simulation solutions together. The success of this partnership will grow through this acquisition, through the skills transfer of valuable domain expertise provided by MWPowerlab to Schneider which will in turn drive the continued innovation and digitisation of the entire value chain. The sustained development into Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality has culminated in the technology becoming more accessible to diverse global markets including South Africa, says Schneider Electric South Africa Vice President for Industry Business, says Marc Ramsay.Meanwhile, Maurizio Galardo, the President of MWPowerlab s.r.l. expressed delight in being part of the Schneider Electric team. Our Virtual and Augmented Reality technology is now highly optimised for industrial applications, as a result of working with Schneider Electric over the past five years. Together I believe we can unleash the power of 3D real-time technology across the Simualtion, Asset Management and HMI Supervisory solutions that are part of the Schneider industrial software portfolio, he said.
