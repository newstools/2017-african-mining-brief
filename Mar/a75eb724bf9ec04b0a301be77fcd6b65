After a rigorous process of evaluation, the Government of Botswana, through the Ministry of Mineral Resources, Green Technology and Energy Security, has finally granted a mining licence to the Sese Joint Venture for a coal project. The Sese Joint Venture comprises of TSX-listed First Quantum Minerals and ASX-listed African Energy Resources.Covering an area of 51.47 km2 and containing 650 Mt of raw coal in measured and indicated resources, the approved mining license contains sufficient coal in the higher quality SS seam for the currently contemplated 450 MW power project at Sese, plus multiple expansions.Valid for 25 years, the mining licence can be extended by a further period of up to 25 years on written application to the minister of mineral resources, green technology and energy security not less than 12 months before expiry of the license.Together with the previously approved land rights and environmental approval, the mining license gives the owner the right to erect all buildings and infrastructure required to implement the project.After the granting of the mining licence, the generation and export licence permit is the only step that remains before the Sese integrated coal and power project can commence.The Sese Integrated Power Project comprises a power station complex with its own captive coal mine. The initial development concept is centred on an initial 300 MW power station (2 x 150 MW CFB boilers) with a captive 1.5 Mtpa coal mine. Additional 300 MW developments are proposed as capacity is contracted.
