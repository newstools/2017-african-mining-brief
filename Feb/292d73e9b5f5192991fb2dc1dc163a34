Together with three other models: the CPLT V15 LED, CPLB6 LED and CPLT H6, LED it provides users the widest choice when it comes to sourcing the safest and most efficient light tower for multiple applications and industries.The CPLB2 LED light tower is ideal for construction, mining and events, to name just a few industries.
