South African mining company, Canyon Coal, says it has updated to make its website accommodate deaf and visually impaired users, whose interests had been overlooked.Calling this development a first amongst South African companies, Canyon Coal, says it collaborated with the South African National Deaf Association (SANDA) in order to compile a website that meets the standards set out on the South African National Council for the Blind (SANCB), as part of its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR).The information has been translated into South African sign language, making it accessible to the deaf community. Furthermore, to make it a blind-friendly one, some specific web design methods, which are specific to the goal, have been used.On why his company undertook this initiative, Vuslat Bayoglu, the Canyon Coal s Executive Chairman, comments: The deaf community, in South Africa is struggling to make South African Sign Language the 12th official language of the country. As Canyon Coal, we hear their voices and shoulder the responsibility of diminishing their barriers as much as we can. He adds: As Canyon Coal, a socially responsible corporate citizen, we are aware that taking these baby steps is not a favor but is our obligation to South African people with special needs and the society as a whole. As being the first South African mining company having a disabled-friendly website , we hope to spark the sensitivity and responsibility for disabled people of South Africa.
