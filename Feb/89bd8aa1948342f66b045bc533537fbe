Living up to President Muhammadu Buhari s promise to clean Nigerian s corruption-riddled oil sector, a federal high court in Lagos has ordered a former minister, minister Diezani Alison-Madueke, to pay back $153.3 million, the money which she is alleged to have siphoned from state run firm, Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and stashed in three banks.The country s main anti-corruption body, Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), brought the case, which Judge Muslim Hassan passed judgment in its favour.Alison-Madueke was appointed as by former president, Goodluck Jonathan.For years, previous governments have not acted on allegations of gross corruption at NNPC, which is directly under the control of the minister of oil.Nigeria has earns billions of dollars from its crude oil exports annually, but the majority of its citizens, whom, according to aid agencies and the World Bank are said to survive on less than two dollars a day. The country s transport, water and electricity infrastructure is in a state of disrepair due to years of neglect. Access to primary health care is a privilege for the average Nigerian.
