Out of the Box Energy Solutions are the first OEM s in Africa to integrate PWRstation retractable solar racking technology into intermodal transport containers creating mobile solar gensets.South African-based Out of the Box Energy Solutions, a company specialising in distributed renewable energy technologies is Africa s first Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) to integrate into intermodal transport containers PWRstation s retractable solar racking technology called EXOractm and resell fully assembled Class S 10-50 solar gensets.It is estimated that by 2035 more than 80 percent of all new energy production and consumption will be in developing nations, where energy infrastructure today is limited, unstable or non-existent. The Out of the Box Energy Solutions OEM / reseller agreement with PWRstation ideally positions the company in what is today a rapidly emerging market, especially in mining, oil and gas, telecom, rural electrification and remote communities where demand for renewable energy is exploding.&nbsp;PWRstation s transportable Class S10-50 gensets are built on the company s proprietary retractable PV racking platforms sold under the brand name EXOractm. This unique technology enables simplified, ultra-rapid solar deployments of variable durations, while providing users with the ability to easily relocate their solar assets when needed.The Class S10-50 (which stands for 10&#215;10 foot container with 50 integrated solar panels) is a practical plug and play alternative to today s traditional fixed solar installations which often take months or more to deliver while tying-up land and capital for 20 years. We re excited to be Africa s first OEM to assemble and resell the Class S product line, says Out of the Box Energy Solutions Founder, Robert Jardine. He adds, the Class S products are a perfect complement to our product range of mobile hybrid power systems.
