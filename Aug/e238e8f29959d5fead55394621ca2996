General Kinematics has introduced a new solution to simplify the intensive process of managing rock, minerals and other bulk materials.According to the company report, High-Frequency Screen or Feeder is a fiscally responsible solution for powder and bulk processing meant to enhance bulk materials production processes.Equipped with innovative, patent-pending structural springs, this new design is an ideal solution for powder and bulk processing.The High-Frequency design provides overall improved fines screening and feeding. Features include a smaller natural frequency motor resulting in cost savings compared to brute force, this new unit is available as a screen or a feeder and with food grade steel depending on your application.Without the limit of vertical deflection commonly seen by brute force equipment, the Structural Springs allow for longer units in a smaller footprint. The unique capabilities of the High-Frequency Screen or Feeder result in a high-performance solution to maximize sorting in your process.For over 50 years, General Kinematics has set the standard for vibratory process equipment.
