By Carla Collett, Senior Associate at Webber WentzelFor the second time in history, the African continent has become a focal point for global expansion. As a result, valuable goods, services and intellectual property are being exported into Africa. With this expansion comes the reality of increased demand, and competition and the risk of imitation. It is therefore crucial that intellectual property rights are adequately protected before embarking on any expansion strategy.Any intellectual property expansion strategy must be structured to optimally protect intellectual property rights and brand value. Some of the factors to be taken into account are:There are two regional intellectual property offices operating in Africa, being the African Regional Intellectual Property Organisation (ARIPO) and the African Intellectual Property Organisation (OAPI). An ARIPO registration facilitates the central filing of trade marks, designs or patents in any or all of the designated member states. Although a single application is filed to cover more than one designated member state, the registration which results is essentially a national registration in each designated member state. An OAPI trade mark, design or patent registration extends automatically to all 17 member states.The protection of trade marks in strategic territories and territories which form part of retail distribution routes is also a useful mechanism in the fight against counterfeiting, which is an ever present reality when trading on the African continent.There are many considerations to be borne in mind in relation to the protection and exploitation of intellectual property rights in Africa. Therefore, in order to successfully compete in the African market, it is advisable to consider a holistic expansion strategy before scrambling into Africa.
