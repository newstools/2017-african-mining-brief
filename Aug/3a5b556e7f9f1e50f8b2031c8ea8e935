Sandvik Mining and Rock Technology has launched the new Sandvik UNIFACE down-the-hole (DTH) range of drill bits. With long bit life essential to cutting costs and improving productivity, the service life of Sandvik UNIFACE bits can be as much as 80 percent longer than current Sandvik bits.Sandvik UNIFACE is designed for optimized flushing that gives a more even wear of the gauge, increasing the life of the bit. In order to achieve a consistent penetration rate, the buttons have been placed so that they always hit fresh rock.The tool life improvements delivered by the Sandvik UNIFACE design also yield significant health and safety benefits, since operators spend less time changing tools. The new bit design essentially delivers more drill metres per shift compared with a standard bit, thanks to less frequent bit changes, says Johan Bergquist, global product line manager DTH tools, Sandvik Mining and Rock Technology. The result is a design with a number of features that are new to the industry and that significantly increase bit life, while maintaining penetration rate.
