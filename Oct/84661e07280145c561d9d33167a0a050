While the annual death toll of mine workers has decreased significantly over the years, the 73 people who lost their lives in 2016 is still an unacceptable loss to our country and our economy. Fortunately, new enamel paint developed by Kansai Plascon can make a difference. It is guaranteed to make safety information and warning signs more visible in challenging environments, such as mines. Rolf Redelinghuys from Kansai Plascon says that the high quality and robustness of the mine-marking enamel ensures that warnings and signs are highly visible underground regardless of how dusty or wet it may be. “As a result, the workplace becomes safer for miners as they can easily identify hazardous areas and situations.” The paint is also weather resistant; an important feature in the extreme conditions that prevail underground. Safety information and warning signs remain a cornerstone of creating a safe work environment. Safety signs and their visibility are crucial in helping employees negotiate high risk working environments. Safety signs have to be visible to be effective. Conditions underground are generally not conducive to visibility due to dust, water, mist and extreme temperatures. These conditions combine to obscure signs and make them illegible. Developed specifically for the mining industry, the product has already passed stringent product tests and approval processes of the major mining houses – a demonstration of Plascon’s commitment to developing solutions that are literally,  Designed for Life. Plascon’s innovative new enamel product is proving that safety compliance is achieved by paying due attention to the details. Paint might not be the first thing that comes to mind in a safety discussion, but it can improve the working conditions and safety of the workers on whom the mining industry depends.
