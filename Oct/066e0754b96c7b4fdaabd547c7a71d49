The Commission for Mediation and Arbitration will facilitate wage negotiations between the National Union of Mineworkers and Sibanye Stillwater’s Kroondaal operation following an earlier deadlocked on negotiations. The National Union of Mineworkers is demanding R10 500 for category B and 15% for category A while the company is offering  5,5% for category A and R750 for category B. CCMA will be  facilitating the negotiation on 2 November 2017 in Rustenburg. The demands by the union includes wage increase, housing allowance, medical aid and leave days. With regard to wages, the Union  is demanding R10 500 for the lowest paid and 15% for the highest paid employees. Housing allowance, medical aid and leave days The  Union  is demanding a living out allowance of R5 000 and housing subsidy R10 000, whilst  demanding 100% medical aid contribution by the employer, and  a fully paid 35 days annual leave days and 42 days sick leave. Maternity leave The union is demanding four months fully paid maternity leave. “The National Union of Mineworkers views the wage offer by Sibanye Stillwater as an insult because the lowest paid employees are currently earning R6 400.” In addition the union states it “deplores dirty tactics and the arrogant attitude displayed by the company during the wage negotiations until we deadlocked”. “We remain unshakeable on these demands and we will not and never accept Sibanye Stillwater’s insult wage increase of 5,5% and R750. “Mineworkers continue to risk their lives deep below the surface of the earth to produce platinum, but they still earn poverty wages,” states the union in a press statement.
