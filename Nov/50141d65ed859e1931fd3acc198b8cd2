The Ministry of Mineral Resources and Energy of Mozambique intends to revise its mining licensing process in order to minimise or  eliminate possible corruption practices. This follows the decisions that was adopted at the Third Coordinating Council held  Matola, outside the capital Maputo. The minister Mineral Resources and Energy, Leticia Klemens, expressed concern about evidence of corruption in the granting of mining licenses.  According to the Mozambican daily newspaper Noticias, the minister calls on staff to set up preventive measures  in order to apply administrative or criminal penalties. The spokesman for the Coordinating Council, Afonso Mabica, told the newspaper that this issue had been discussed “fairly in-depth and we found that, in fact, there is a need to improve the way we serve the public, so as to facilitate the licensing process.” The ministry has so far this year, sought the cancellation of 85 mining licences, because of a number of irregularities. Mabica also said the meeting was positive, because the majority of the objectives proposed in the Economic and Social Plan for 2017 and the Government’s Five Year Programme for the sector are being achieved. The spokesman for the Coordinating Council added that a representative of Italian group ENI had made a presentation on the evolution of the project for exploration of natural gas deposits in the Rovuma basin.
