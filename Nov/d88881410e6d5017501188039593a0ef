Concor Opencast Mining has announced that the company recently secured two new contracts as well as an extension to an existing project. Concor Opencast Mining is part of Concor Construction which was acquired by a consortium led by Southern Palace Group and managing director, Eric Wisse says that as a proudly Level 1 B-BBEE contributor the company is well positioned to secure further projects in the mining sector. Wisse says that a substantial contract, worth roughly 47 million dollars, was confirmed with Anglo American Platinum ending the year off on a positive note. Concor Opencast Mining teams will provide load and haul services at the Zwartfontein Pit on the Mogalakwena mine. This is a 36 month contract. “Significantly, the company will also continue its work at the Blinkwater tailings dam facility at Mogalakwena for another two years, as an extension to an existing contract,” he says . Concor Opencast Mining also secured a contract at Mafube colliery’s Lifex project. Mafube is a joint venture between Anglo Coal and Exxaro. The scope of work on this contract comprises the development of the boxcut that will enable roll-over mining operations upon completion of the project. Another recently awarded contract is the 36 month drill and blast contract at the Vlakfontein mine near Ogies in Mpumalanga. Wisse says that there has been an increase in enquiries over the past few months. “I believe this is directly linked to an increased optimism in the mining industry due to improving commodity prices, despite the other challenges this industry faces.”
