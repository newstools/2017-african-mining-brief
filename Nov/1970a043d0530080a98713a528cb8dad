Kenya’s Cabinet Secretary in the Mining Ministry, the Hon. Dan Kazungu, will once again open the Kenya Mining Forum that is returning to Nairobi from 4-5 December, following a hugely successful inaugural event last year. “Since 2016’s Mining Forum,” says Hon Kazungu, “Kenya has jumped 16 positions in the world’s most attractive mining investment destinations globally from position 102 to 86 according to a survey by Fraser Institute. This has been attributed to six key pillars of Kenya’s Mining reform agenda that are driving transformation. These include the 20 year Mining Strategy and Roadmap, Mining and Minerals policy, Mining Act 2016, comprehensive and progressive mining regulations, robust competitive and attractive fiscal policy and current geo data.” He adds: “great significant strides have also been made in reforming our mining regulatory framework in Kenya among them; the operationalization of the online mining cadastre, which enables a transparent online application of mining licenses. Another key reform is the implementation of the Mining Act 2016, which has seen 14 mining regulations effected, ushering in a new dawn for a modern and forward looking mining sector in the country.” This year’s Kenya Mining Forum is once again hosted by the Kenya Ministry of Mining, in collaboration with the Chamber of Mines. A varied conference programme focuses on industry issues and challenges ranging from finance, legislation, women in mining, the gemstone sector to CSR. The expo showcases leading technology and services for the sector while a practical workshop programme offers free training and up skilling for mining professionals.
