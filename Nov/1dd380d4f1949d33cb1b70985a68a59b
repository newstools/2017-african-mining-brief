A Carter Center report has confirmed that hundreds of millions of dollars from  the Democratic Republic of Congo’s mineral revenue is still misappropriated  since the ouster of corrupt  dictator, Mobutu Sese Seko, twenty years ago. State-owned Gecamines, which Sese Seko and his cronies used to siphon billions of mineral revenue for personal use for just over three decades, account for about $750m in revenue from  copper and cobalt mines between 2011 and 2014 , the Carter Center said on Friday. The US foundation, which is the brainchild of former USA President, Jimmy Carter, has faulted Gecamines for negligence in failing to track who benefited from missing billions. In a country blessed with billions worth of natural resources, the average citizen of DRC survives on less than a dollar a day if they are lucky. Carter Centre admitted that revenue from mining companies prove difficult to  be accounted of. “Those revenues are not directed to the public treasury, and they are largely beyond the realm of public oversight,” it said.
