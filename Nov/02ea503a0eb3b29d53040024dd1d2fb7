After a false dawn of falling statistics, worryingly, South Africa fatalities in the mining sector have spiked again, according to the Chamber of Mines. The deaths of mine workers at the Anglo American Platinum (Amplats) and AngloGold Ashanti few weeks ago took the South African mining industry’s total deaths to 76 for 2017 – three more than  the whole of 2016. In a statement, the Chamber of Mines said it was concerned that the increase negated the consistent improvement the industry had seen over the past two decades. Since the dawn of democracy, between 1993 and 2016, the number of fatalities in the industry declined by around 88%. Fatalities as a result of fall of ground incidents declined by 92% over the same period. Accidents in the second half of 2017 have blighted what, for a moment seemed to be, a relatively better record. Amplats announced that an employee was fatally injured in a fall of ground incident which occurred on October 31 at the company’s Union Mine, Spud Shaft. AngloGold Ashanti said two employees were fatally injured at its Mponeng Mine on November 1 after a seismic event triggered a fall of ground.
