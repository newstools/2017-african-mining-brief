Anglo American Platinum (Amplats) platinum group’s smelter project at Unki mine in Zimbabwe, which was carried out to meet the demands of former President, Robert Mugabe, who has was forced to resign last month, is 70% complete. The smelter needs electrical systems to be installed and will be commissioned by mid-2018. Matte produced will be sent to Amplats’ base metals and precious metals refineries in South Africa. Mugabe government instructed platinum group metals (PGM) miners to consider beneficiating or adding value to their raw materials in the country, or face a 15% export levy on shipments of concentrate to smelters and refineries in South Africa. At this stage beneficiation in Zimbabwe is not viable, as the amount of metal coming from the country’s mines is relatively small, according to platinum producers in the country.
