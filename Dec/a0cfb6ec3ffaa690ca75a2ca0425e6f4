 In a move to demonstrate its commitment to global efforts to stem climate change, Australian mining giant, BHP said it would disassociate itself from the global lobby group, World Coal Association (WCA), according to a report filed by news agency, AFP. BHP said it would review the preliminary decision to leave the WCA by March 2018. The miner has differed with WCA on its stance pertaining to the clean energy target, which supports investment in renewables in Australia. WCA said it preferred clean coal to renewables, while BHP said its policy was to tackle climate change through the use of all technologies. According to AFP, the BHP has been reviewing its industry group memberships to see if their stances align with its view that climate change must be tackled through emissions reductions and the use of renewable energy. A 22-page report released on Tuesday found that the organisations as well as the Minerals Council of Australia held different positions from BHP, which derived just under 20% of its total revenue from coal in the year ended June 2017. BHP’s chief external affairs officer, Geoff Healy, said the report demonstrated the firm’s support for action on climate change and commitment to transparency. “While we won’t always agree with our industry associations, we will continue to call out material differences where they exist and we will take action where necessary, as we have done today,” he said in a statement. BHP also said that it would review its membership of the US Chamber of Commerce, as it disagreed with the US Chamber of Commerce’s rejection of the Paris Agreement and a carbon-pricing policy. A decision on whether to leave the US Chamber of Commerce would be made by March. Source: AFP
