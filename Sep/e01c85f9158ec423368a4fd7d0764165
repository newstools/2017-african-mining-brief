Atlas Copco s HM 1500 fixed hydraulic (hydro) magnet, fitted to a 22.5 ton carrier, is efficiently and safely sorting and loading steel off cuts at a steel mill in Emalahleni, Mpumalanga.Following a successful tender, service contract specialist, Real Tree Trading, was contracted to remove steel off cuts generated from the steel production process. After being cut into various lengths, the steel I-beam off cuts, weighing anything between 150 and 300kg, have to be heaped and loaded onto trucks for transportation to a steel works in Vanderbijl where they are resmelted and recycled back into the steel fabrication process, explains Real Tree Trading Group Manager, Gert Ootshuizen. Ably assisted by Masike Seritili Contract Manager, Oosthuizen oversees the project that involves a team of 46 workers operating in the cutting, splitting, scrap and dispatch areas. This is the first time that we are involved in scrap cutting and removal and we needed a fast, efficient and equally important, safe bulk handling solution. An OEM referred us to Atlas Copco Power Technique distributor, Riviera Hire, for a solution. According to Riviera Hire Managing Director, Filippo Bevilacqua, following a site inspection they immediately recommended the Atlas Copco hydro magnet as the ideal solution. Atlas Copco and Riviera demonstrated the hydro magnet and impressed with the product s performance, Real Tree Trading placed the order with Riviera Sales in Q1 2017. We were able to supply the unit within a week, confirms Bevilacqua.Established in 2004, machine and attachment rental and sales specialist, Riviera Hire is committed to forging long-term customer partnerships within the construction, plant hire and mining industries. The company provides a value add rental service supported by four pillars of excellence &#8211; product offering, training, service support and turnaround time. We appointed Riviera Hire as a distributor almost three years ago and have supplied the rental company with a number of products including three Atlas Copco hammers, the EC140, EC135 and ES70, a compacter, a bucket crusher as well as the hydro magnet, says Area Sales Manager for Atlas Copco Power Technique, Amanda Roets.&nbsp;
